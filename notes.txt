ideas for visualizations to include:

uhist (univariate histograms): 
 - accept a single vector or a matrix or dataframe
 - allow the user to interactively change # of bins
 - mouseover: ??
 - bonus: filter on another variable

mplot (multivariate plot):
 - single, large, bivariate scatterplot
 - slider for selecting:
 	- x variable
 	- y variable
 	- bubble size (scale) variable
 	- color variable
 - mouseover: observation number/row name? could potentially have a slider for this as well
