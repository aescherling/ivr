mplot (multivariate plot):
 - single, large, bivariate scatterplot
 - slider for selecting:
 	- x variable

gplot (graphical network plot): 
 - color by covariates
 - size by covariates
 - mouseover: give name or covariates

lmplot:
 - interactive version of plot(lm())?
 - ??

splot (sensitivity analysis):
??

pcplot (principal components analysis):
??
