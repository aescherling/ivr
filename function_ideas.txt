*** ideas for visualizations to include ***

uhist (univariate histograms): 
 - accept a single vector or a matrix or dataframe
 - allow the user to interactively change # of bins
 - display summary statistics?
 - display # of missing values?
 - mouseover: ??
 - bonus: filter on another variable

mplot (multivariate plot):
 - single, large, bivariate scatterplot
 - slider for selecting:
 	- x variable
 	- y variable
 	- bubble size (scale) variable
 	- color variable
 - tooltip with observation number/row name? could potentially have a slider for this as well

iview (interactive table view):
 - open the data in a table. easy to scroll both vertically and horizontally.
 - sort on variables
 - filter

gplot (graphical network plot): 
 - color by covariates
 - size by covariates
 - mouseover: give name or covariates

lmplot:
 - interactive version of plot(lm())?
 - ??

splot (sensitivity analysis):
??

pcplot (principal components analysis):
??

caplot (correspondence analysis):
